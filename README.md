Just left the theater. Head’s spinning like a clothes dryer. Man, Drop was a mix of cold syrupy waves and electric flashes. Can still taste the popcorn, crunchy ghosts between my teeth. Oh, the bits of paper stuck to my shoe...glancing down, stupid purple flyer. Anyway, back to Drop. It was like...like a cat jumping through a flaming hoop covered in glitter and you can't even remember how you got there.

There’s this one scene, remember? Like, the protagonist just standing at a crosswalk. The way her scarf kept blowing like it was alive, or whispering secrets? Made me think of that time in Amsterdam—never mind, it’s off topic. She didn't even say much, but those eyes spoke in Morse code, kinda mesmerizing.

> Everyone else in the theater was like they’re sitting on a different planet. This one guy right? Crunching candy way too loud, like thunder in a library, and I swear the lady behind me kept asking her partner to download the movie—can you even download a movie like this one? You gotta watch the movie, sink into it like an old couch.

All these sounds in my head, mixin’ up the movie and these awful seats. My back's arguing with me louder than the surround sound. Like, was Drop about loss or finding that weird key to another dimension? The explosion with the pineapples—that's stuck in my mind. Not sure why. I guess it was kinda, uh... like when you realize you didn’t save your essay and your laptop shuts down. Sudden chaos.

Wasn't just what you see, but the stuff you felt, under your skin—like, the movie’s a unreliable narrator, draped in mismatched robes. It kept pullin’ you in, then slapping you with a soggy noodle. The music couldn’t decide either, went from violins to maracas in a blink or sneeze. Kept thinking, what if it’s really about that sand crab I lost in 3rd grade? Maybe less about the plot, maybe about how it makes your head feel like fizzy pop.

I'm driftin'—I didn't even explain the twist! It’s like when your GPS turns into a toaster. The ending was...tidy chaos? Perfect mess. Whatever, you see it yourself. Think John said to ask if you can download the thing... not sure if that’s legal or whatever.
